## Games I've Made

**About These Projects:** At school, we had the opportunity to create games as part of an elective class. These games are long-term projects under a mini-scrum development strategy. Each was developed in Unity as an individual project or part of a team. Below are the more fun or interesting projects I've been a part of.

Due to my disdain for using mismatching art assets, I did the sprite work for these games. Our Katamari game, however, required a multitude of objects, which made independent development of 3D models impossible for a class project.

### 1. Grover Man

Grover Man is a satirical take on our college's personality; most students are conservative-libertarian. As such, we decided to model the 'perfect Grover' as a freedom fighter, saving his fellow students from the forces of Communism under the reign of Mecha Karl Marx. This game features two levels, four unlockable achievements, easter eggs, simple state-based AI, and a three-stage boss battle. Sprite design and voice acting was all done in-house. This was a group project.

### 2. One Trillion Lions vs. The Sun 2

This is my first solo 3D game, and it plays off the following thought experiment: In a battle of power, who would win? One trillion lions, or the sun?

>   "It depends if we can collapse them to their Schwarzschild radius." - Me

>   "Well, are they all working together, or are they independent?" - My programming 2 professor

>   "I feel that if they can get to the sun then organization is the least of their concerns." - The student who inspired me to make this game

It includes two different enemies, an asteroid that fractures into more when you shoot it and a flare-shooting star, as well as a progressive difficulty scale. All voxel models and textures were done in the span of a week to remove placeholder models, for better or worse.

### 3. Communisuto Damacy

Communisuto Damacy tells an alternate story of Grover Man from the Communist point of view. You play as a glorious ball of stuff that must roll around a small American office and pick up as much stuff as possible, just like the original Katamari Damacy. The ball grows in size and rolls differently if you pick up special "irregular" objects, unless you are so large that they wouldn't matter anyways. The game ends after a time limit, and your success is judged by the size of the ball you make.

### 4. Net Surfer

My most recent game, Net Surfer, is based on the 80s view of a cyberpunk future. You play as AxelLee.exe, the first future ninja robo cyber cop. You have to race through the internet, shooting down malicious entities and surviving bloatware obstacles. This is an infinite runner with progressive speedup, and it is by far my most visually stunning game. It is a low-power single-scene game, and it takes advantage of a post-processing VHS effect and vignette for an old-school CRT TV style. Additionally, it uses Unity's inverse kinematic system and Blender's quick skeletal setup system to implement a fluid point animation, which draws the user towards their crosshair even if it is lost in the effects.

### 5. Underlord

This game is an upcomming idea for our networked games course. The running theory is one of two games:

1. A roguelite, cooperative for 3 with a single enemy-spawning and enemy-controlling adversary
2. A dwarf-fortress like game with a single player working to store food for the winter and another controlling 3 gnomes trying to disrupt the dwarf boss' progress.
