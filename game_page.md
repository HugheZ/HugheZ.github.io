## Games I've Made

**About These Projects:** At school, we had the opportunity to create games as part of an elective class. These games are long-term projects under a mini-scrum development strategy. Each was developed in Unity as an individual project or part of a team. Below are the more fun or interesting projects I've been a part of.

Due to my disdain for using mismatching art assets, I did the sprite work for these games. Our Katamari game, however, required a multitude of objects, which made independent development of 3D models impossible for a class project.

### 1. Grover Man

Grover Man is a satirical take on our college's personality; most students are conservative-libertarian. As such, we decided to model the 'perfect Grover' as a freedom fighter, saving his fellow students from the forces of Communism under the reign of Mecha Karl Marx. This game features two levels, four unlockable achievements, easter eggs, simple state-based AI, and a three-stage boss battle. Sprite design and voice acting was all done in-house. This was a group project.

### 2. One Trillion Lions vs. The Sun 2

This is my first solo 3D game, and it plays off the following thought experiment: In a battle of power, who would win? One trillion lions, or the sun?

>   "It depends if we can collapse them to their Schwarzschild radius." - Me

>   "Well, are they all working together, or are they independent?" - My programming 2 professor

>   "I feel that if they can get to the sun then organization is the least of their concerns." - The student who inspired me to make this game

It includes two different enemies, an asteroid that fractures into more when you shoot it and a flare-shooting star, as well as a progressive difficulty scale. All voxel models and textures were done in the span of a week to remove placeholder models, for better or worse.

### 3. Communisuto Damacy

### 4. Net Surfer

### 5. Underlord

This game is an upcomming idea for our networked games course. The running theory is one of two games:

1. A roguelite, cooperative for 3 with a single enemy-spawning and enemy-controlling adversary
2. A dwarf-fortress like game with a single player working to store food for the winter and another controlling 3 gnomes trying to disrupt the dwarf boss' progress.
