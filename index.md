### School Projects

#### [Pong Pow](https://github.com/HugheZ/PongPow)

This was a pong game based in 6502 assembly, an assembly language with only 2 registers, an accumulator, and 8 bit operations. The game makes use of memory-mapped video output to load sprites to the screen by indexing columns and rows on the video memory page. The game implements a power shot feature, game speedup, and pausing.

#### [Computti Tutti](https://github.com/Ivoah/ComputtiTutti)

Computti Tutti is a simple Java computer-assisted instructor (CAI). The project was developed over the course of a semester with two main sprints, during the first of which I was scrum master. I was in charge of aggregating open-source textbooks and writing more beginner-friendly instructions, writing some boilerplate questions, improving UX through progress bar color changing, and implementing a simple Bayesian classifier through the use of difficulty priors. The app was created in C# using WinForms, the precursor to WPF.

### [ML Projects](ML_page.md)

I'm new to both machine learning and artificial intelligence, but I've had the opprotunity to apply some basic models, to both interesting and humorous results. This is a small collection of my projects in the area.

### [My games](game_page.md)

A collection of games I've worked on can be found here. All were developed in Unity, and the list contains a mix of platforming and homages.

### Personal Stuff

#### [Tabletop Helper](https://github.com/HugheZ/Tabletop_Helper)

This is a tabletop assistant designed for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, built using the Python wrapper for QT, PyQt. It allows for character creation while streamlining the process by auto-calculating modifiers and providing roll buttons for skills and weapons. Additionally, the app provides a quick lookup solution by issuing HTTP requests to two D&D REST APIs, as well as a simple initiative tracker for large groups and encounters.
